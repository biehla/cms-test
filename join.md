The McMaster Mars Rover Team will bring together McMaster students with an interest in space and space technologies to gain real world experience while solving a technical problem. It will also allow students at McMaster and in the local community to participate in the design and construction of a functional Mars Rover, created to compete in international competitions. Furthermore, provide networking opportunities to members and non-member McMaster students for entry into the aerospace field.

We are always looking for new curious, passionate, and hard-working members. But you might be asking yourself, how exactly can I join this team?
